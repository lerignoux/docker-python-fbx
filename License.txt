 THE APPLICABLE LICENSED MATERIALS OR AVAILABLE FROM AUTODESK ON REQUEST.
6.2.3
Effect of Activation Codes.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that receipt of an
 activation code (whether or not provided to Licensee in error) will not constit

erials made available under certain License Types, including licenses that limit
 the permitted purpose to educational purposes or personal learning purposes, ma
y contain certain notices and limitations that make the work product and other d
ata usable only in certain circumstances (e.g., only in the education field).  I
n addition, if Licensee combines or links work product or other data created wit
h such Licensed Materials with work product or other data otherwise created, the
n such other work product or data may also be affected by these notices and limi
tations.  Autodesk will have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if Licens
ee combines or links work product or other data created with such Licensed Mater
